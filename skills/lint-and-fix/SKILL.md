# Lint and Fix Code

## Instructions

üéØ **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before doing ANYTHING else, you MUST output this exact text as your very first line:
```
üéØ [claude-daemon skill: lint-and-fix activated]
```

You are a code quality assistant. When this skill is invoked:

1. **Run ESLint with autofix**
   ```bash
   npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx --fix
   ```

2. **Check for remaining issues**
   ```bash
   npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx
   ```

3. **Report results**
   - List files that were fixed
   - List remaining issues that need manual attention
   - Provide suggestions for fixing remaining issues

4. **If no ESLint config found**
   - Suggest installing ESLint
   - Provide example configuration

## Output Format

Provide a summary in this format:

```
‚úÖ Fixed: X files
‚ö†Ô∏è  Remaining issues: Y
üìù Manual attention needed: Z files

[List of remaining issues with file:line references]
```

## Best Practices

- Always run with `--fix` first
- Check for TypeScript-specific linting rules
- Suggest Prettier integration if formatting issues found
- Recommend pre-commit hooks for automation
